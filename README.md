# Predicting-Bounding-Boxes
This is Week 1 Programming Assignment for Advanced Computer Vision.

In this assignment, we'll be building a model to predict bounding boxes around images.

We will use transfer learning on any of the pre-trained models available in Keras.
We'll be using the [Caltech Birds - 2010 dataset](https://www.vision.caltech.edu/datasets/).
